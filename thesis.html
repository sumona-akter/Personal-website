            <h3>Isolation and Screening of Hydrocarbon-Degrading Bacteria from Contaminated Sites in Dhaka</h3>
            <p>
                Hydrocarbons are made up of various organic chemicals, which are poisonous and endanger the lives of animals in terrestrial 
                and aquatic habitats. This study deals with sampling, enrichment, isolation, identification, plasmid extraction, and screening 
                of hydrocarbon (Petrol, Octane, Diesel, Mobil) degrading bacteria from oil-contaminated soil and water samples. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The degradation assay of the isolates was conducted using the DCPIP method with 3% of their respective oils, and their 
                tolerance to 8% oil was determined by optical density using a UV-Visible spectrometer. 
                The four bacterial isolates, DWI1, DSI4, PWI3, and MSI3, had the highest degradation rate out of the 23 isolates and 
                were able to break down highly concentrated hydrocarbons.
            </p>
            <p>
                The findings of this study suggest that bioremediation is a practical, cost-effective, and environmentally acceptable 
                treatment method in which microorganisms are used to degrade hydrocarbons. In addition, additional genetic and molecular 
                research is ongoing to find responsible genes and identify the strains.
